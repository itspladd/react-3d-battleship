# shootyboats
A 3D interface for a Battleship-like game built with React and [three.js](https://threejs.org/). Under the hood, my [battleship-engine](https://github.com/itspladd/battleship-engine) code runs the game logic.

## ðŸš§ Development paused ðŸš§

Currently, this is an early proof-of-concept, **not a full playable game**. Feel free to download the repo and mess around with it locally!

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `npm install`
